# Wholesale_Customers
This repository contains my project on wholesale culstomers clustering

The dataset used in this project is the Wholesale Customers Dataset , which we downloaded from [the UCI directory] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation ; It is a dataframe with 8 variables,  and 440 instances.
The objective of this part is to build and compare clustering models for these wholesale customers based on the 8 variables. 6 variables in our dataframe are  numerical and two of them are categorical (numbers but not continuous and order is not important).
We will apply k-means clustering as well as hierarchical clustering.

I've done all the coding on google colab in the following link:
